# Github Workflow

Github uses `google-github-actions` to access to  Google Cloud using Workload Identity Federation

GCP's Workload Identity Federation (WIF) leverages authenticates external systems and provides access management to
external workloads running in external providers such as AWS, Azure, GitHub or with any
identity provider (IdP) that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC).
